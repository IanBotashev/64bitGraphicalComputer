# Documentation Folder
This folder is used to organize documentation for the project that doesn't necessarily fit into any of the other folders.

## ALU.md
Documentation on the inner workings of the ALU

## ASSEMBLY.md
Contains all of the assembly instructions the CPU has, for specific details check helpers/assembly

## INSTRUCTIONS.md
Rather precariously named, contains all of the documentation for microinstructions.
